# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Graceful startup: If a component fails to initialize, continue with others
- [ ] Git functions: Basic git operations (status, diff, add, commit, push, pull)
- [ ] External tools: Auto-detect and integrate dev tools (npm, pip, cargo, docker)
- [ ] Obsidian integration: Create/search notes, link to development context

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Better error messages with suggested fixes
- [ ] Configuration file instead of hardcoded settings
- [ ] Plugin system for custom project managers
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
